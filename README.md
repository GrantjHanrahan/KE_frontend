## Approach
* After writing down the requirements of the challenge I chose to focus on completing the project using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS. This was partly due to setting myself the goal of completing the project on the same day that I received it but I also wanted to practice my JS skills after using mainly HTML, PHP and Wordpress for the passed few months.
* Once I had settled on the tech stack I started building the HTML foundations for the two column layout whilst also checking syntx compatibility through [Can I Use](https://caniuse.com/#home)
* The CSS styling was fairly straighforward once I started to add styling to each element. For the two column layout I used `float: left`, in hindsight I should have used either the flexbox or grid properties.
* My use of JS was fairly minimal (which is another reason I will be re-completing this project in VueJS), however I was stuck on implementing the image upload. After searching online and trying a few different methods I found a helpful CodePen (link below) which pointed me in the right direction.

## Build Information & Technologies Used

* Time taken: 5 - 6 hours
* Technologies: HTML, CSS, JS (no frameworks used)
* Used Gimp to apply matching styling and colours
* Applied responsive design
* QAT done via BrowserStack to check the compatibility for IE 15+, FireFox 32+, Safari 7.1+, Chrome 38+, Android and iOS.
* Added comments to assist with readability.

## Challenges

* Getting the avatar image to upload was the most difficult part of the test. This [CodePen](https://codepen.io/mobifreaks/pen/LIbca) along with MDN helped.
* As I chose to use Vanilla JS the code does feel more bloated than necessary.

## Things to add

* Form validation, checking of input
* Implement further browser testing/ checking of compatibility
* Re-do project in VueJS
* Use Sass in a VueJS build to prevent repetition in the CSS styling
