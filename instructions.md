Front End Development Test

### The Brief
Task: hCard Builder
Our ever-vigilant design/UX team has put together a layout for an app, *hCard Builder*.
This app is something we would like to use in the future when allowing users to edit their personal details on our site.
Based on the design provided (in `design.psd`), build the *hCard Builder* app in HTML/CSS/Javascript
If you don't have Photoshop available, you can see examples of the empty & completed states in the two provided `.png` files
Allow approximately 4 hours to complete the task.

### Requirements

* As the form is filled out, the preview should be automatically updated in real time.
* The CreateHcard button does not need to function (ie; no back end is required for this task)
* For the Upload Avatar button, when the upload image dialog box appears and the user selects an image, the image should be shown in the thumbnail preview. Bonus points for image crop and size.(no backend upload is required for this task)
* The app should be responsive for different screen widths, desktop and mobile.
* The form should work in the following browsers:
  * Internet Explorer 11+
  * Latest Chrome
  * Latest Firefox

(**Note for bonus points** For oldIE 9 and 10, the form does not have to look identical to more modern browsers, but should be a reasonable approximation, and should still be functional. Where required features are unavailable, the app should gracefully degrade.)

### Guidelines for test marking.

* Feel free to use any of the popular Javascript frameworks or packages to show off your skills such as Vue, React or Angular 4.
* Feel free to use any of the popular CSS frameworks to show off your skills such as Saas or Less.
* We are interested in your Javascript skills, your coding style and use of frameworks and how you solve problems. To this end, please include your source code and any build steps / explanations we may need to test the submission.
* Please make sure your HTML is valid.
* Please structure the code for re-usability.
* Where possible, keep SEO in mind.
* Feel free to use any frameworks or preprocessors you are familiar with. Bonus points for knowledge or use of any preprocessors such as webpack gulp.
* When submitting you app please do not include the node_modules folder, rather include the package.json manifest. We will generate the dependencies.

### Submission

Please submit a *complete* copy of the source code you wrote for this test.
Upon submission, please also give us a guide to how long you spent on the test (There is no wrong answer! We iterate on this test based on the average time taken so we can provide an accurate time-frame for future candidates).
Please submit the source file finals as a zip file. Provide a link to download the zip file as Javascript files usually get blocked by email services. Or contact david@kimberlineducation.com.au to arrange an alternative delivery method.
